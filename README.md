dupcheck
========

Duplicate file checking functions for Rust.

dupcheck can be used to search given directories for any duplicate files found within all directories, or to search for duplicates of specific files, either within their parent directory or within given directories.

Uses the [sha2 v0.1.2](https://crates.io/crates/sha2/0.1.2) crate as part of the file comparison process.
